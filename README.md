The conservation of nature is of global importance and scientists are responsible for monitoring changes in nature, from wildlife populations to landscapes. Tasked with this huge challenge, scientists are turning to new technologies to provide tools that aid in the collection and analysis of data required to better understand wildlife and monitor trends. Using machine learning techniques, we are developing software tools that can identify bears (Ursidae), starting with individual ID using face recognition. By combining this technique with remote camera trap imagery, we aim to provide a new survey technique for use in research and monitoring of wild bears. We anticipate a wide range of end users from scientists and managers, to governments, industries, and community scientists. Our research and software tool will provide a replicable technique and general approach that can be applied to other species beyond bears, which could aid conservation efforts worldwide.
